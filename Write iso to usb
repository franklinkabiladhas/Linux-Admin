###The best utility to burn a .iso to USB drive is "dd". 
####Insert the USB drive and open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
####better be a root (sudo -i), don't be afraid believe in yourself
####use "fdisk -l"  to find the USB device
####fdisk-before

#fdisk -l

--- So in our case its /dev/sdb
###Make sure the USB device is unmounted

#umount /dev/sdb1

####Assuming the .iso file is in your current working folder, type the below command and wait for it to finish.

#dd bs=4M if=ubuntu-12.04.2-server-i386.iso of=/dev/sdb


-----ubuntu-12.04.2-server-i386.iso is your .iso file
-----"bs=4M" is optional. Its just to make it faster
